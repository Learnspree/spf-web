# Serverless Performance Framework (WebApp)

This project originated from a [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8605773) on serverless performance as part of MSc Software Architecture @ [Technological University of Dublin (IT Tallaght)](https://www.it-tallaght.ie).

This project is a simple front-end web-app for the [Serverless Performance Framework](https://github.com/Learnspree/Serverless-Language-Performance-Framework) to display the test results of the relative performance and cost of different language implementations in AWS Lambda and other serverless platforms.

## Pre-Requisites
Use of this application with the SPF backend requires a valid AWS (Amazon Web Services) account.
